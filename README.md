# Non linear equations

The project is presented in the live script `non_linear_equation.mlx` that
reflect the `part_1.m` and `part_2.m` files where are explored the two parts, as 
the name implies, of the assignment.

The first part follows the logistic growth model with utility functions 
located in the following files:
- `picard.m`
- `newton.m`
- `fxsecant.m`
- `secant.m`

The second part follows the non-linear system model with utility functions 
located in the following files:
- `newtonsys.m`
- `broydensys.m`

Once run the program, either by the live script or the two single parts, tables 
that summarize the results of the computations are generated in .csv files
